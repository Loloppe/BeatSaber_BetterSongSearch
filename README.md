# Better Song Search

Searching, downloading and playing songs, now with 100% less annoying!

### This is not meant to be a replacement for SongBrowser or the Standard BeatSaver Downloader as some use cases cant be accomplished, it is merely an addition.

---

Currently compatible game versions: **1.16 and up**

## Install

#### You can always find the latest download in [The Releases](https://github.com/kinsi55/BeatSaber_BetterSongSearch/releases), simply drag the files into the respective folders

- SongCore (Available in ModAssistant)

## Features

- Wide variety of [filtering / searching and sorting options](#Screenshots)
- Absolute banger of a UI that gives you as much information as possible at a single glance
- Uses a locally cached database (Via SongDetailsCache) so all inputs are reflected instantly-ish at the cost of being **unable to find songs which have been uploaded in the last ~12-24 hours**
- **Accessible while in a Multiplayer lobby!**
- Multi-Connection downloads which should make super slow downloads that are not caused by your connection at least 10% less likely
- Button to pick random songs based off your filter settings if you're trying to discover new stuff
- Download queue / history which is kept until the game is closed
- Songs can directly be played from the search, no need to manually look for them after downloading
- If downloads fail for some reason they are retried
